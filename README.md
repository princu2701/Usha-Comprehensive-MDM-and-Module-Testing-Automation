# Usha: Comprehensive MDM and Module Testing Automation

## Project Overview  
**Usha** is a robust automation testing project designed to ensure the quality and reliability of Master Data Management (MDM) systems. This project leverages **Selenium with Java** and the **TestNG** framework to automate testing workflows, ensuring seamless integration and functionality of various modules. Comprehensive documentation was maintained, including detailed bug reports and test cases recorded in Excel sheets.  

## Features and Achievements  
- Conducted **30+ Master Data Management (MDM) tests** to validate data integrity, consistency, and functionality.  
- Performed **pip module testing** to ensure compatibility and proper functionality in diverse environments.  
- Validated **new module additions**, ensuring seamless integration and operational efficiency.  
- Created **detailed bug reports** with comprehensive descriptions, severity levels, and resolution statuses.  
- Designed and executed **test cases**, covering all functional and non-functional requirements.  
- Documented all bug reports and test cases in **Excel sheets** for easy tracking and reporting.  
- Automated testing workflows using **Selenium WebDriver** and organized tests with **TestNG** annotations.  

## Tools and Technologies Used  
- **Programming Language**: Java  
- **Automation Framework**: Selenium WebDriver with TestNG  
- **Documentation**: Microsoft Excel (for bug reports and test cases)  
- **Bug Tracking**: [JIRA/Bugzilla (specify if applicable)]  
- **Other Tools**: Apache POI for Excel integration (if used)  

## Project Highlights  
- Delivered reliable test automation scripts for MDM systems and other modules.  
- Ensured thorough documentation of all bugs and test cases, aiding in streamlined debugging and reporting processes.  
- Improved testing efficiency and coverage by integrating automation tools and methodologies.  

## Folder Structure  
- `src/main/java`: Contains the main Selenium test scripts.  
- `src/test/java`: Contains test cases written in TestNG.  
- `reports/`: Contains generated reports for test execution.  
- `excel-reports/`: Contains bug reports and test cases in Excel format.  

## How to Run the Project  
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.  
2. Configure the necessary dependencies in your Maven `pom.xml` file.  
3. Update the test configurations in the `testng.xml` file.  
4. Execute the tests using TestNG from your IDE or via the command line.  

## Future Enhancements  
- Expand the scope of automation to include performance and security testing.  
- Implement integration with CI/CD pipelines for continuous testing.  
- Enhance reporting by integrating HTML reports for better visualization.
